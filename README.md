# Calc
Simple calculator windows application (WPF) that demonstrates how to use MVVM with .Net Core & Prism.

## Topics:

- Well structured solution repository structure
- MVVM
- Dependency injection
- Prism

## Current status
Early alpha version. Some operations are not implemented yet, but it should compile and run without problems.
Fell free to clone or download the code.
